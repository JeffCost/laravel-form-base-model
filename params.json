{"body":"### Why model forms?\r\n\r\nForms have their own data needs that are separate from the underlying data-types that they may be used to modify. Forms also have different validation needs than these underlying data-types. \r\n\r\nYou may need to populate a drop-down select field with static values from an array or from methods which fetch data from other models. There's no reason to prepare, populate and validate forms in the controller.\r\n\r\nForms may also be constructed \"wizard style\" which splits up a large form into many smaller forms which span many pages. By handling this with the form model your controller won't be filled with session data management code.\r\n\r\nIn short, they provide a place to put things that have traditionally belonged in neither the controller nor our database models.\r\n\r\n[A video explaining a bit more about form models.](http://heybigname.com/2012/05/22/introduction-to-the-form-model/)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Handles form validation\r\n- Easy form field re-population\r\n- Provides a location for defining custom validation rules\r\n- Easily manage form field data across multiple page forms\r\n\r\n### Bundle Installation\r\n\r\nInstall with artisan\r\n\r\n\tphp artisan bundle:install form-base-model\r\n\r\nor, clone the project into **bundles/form-base-model**.\r\n\r\nThen, update your bundles.php to auto-start the bundle.\r\n\r\n\treturn array(\r\n\t\t'form-base-model' => array( 'auto' => true ),\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n**Notice:** The form-base-model bundle comes with examples that will auto-route to http://yoursite/form_examples. Remember to remove this from bundles/form-base-model/start.php when you're finished with the examples.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nAdditional examples and documentation can be found in the README.md file here: https://github.com/ShawnMcCool/laravel-form-base-model/blob/master/README.md","note":"Don't delete this file!
